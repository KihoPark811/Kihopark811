I am a student studying Computer Engineering at Kangwon National University.

My MBTI type is ENFP.
I enjoy communicating with people and participating in various activities.

To briefly introduce myself,

My main interest is game development.
I want to become a client programmer, but I am still learning.

Currently, I am studying C++, Data Structures, and Algorithms.
I plan to learn Unity or Unreal Engine later.

I want to create a game through a team project before I graduate.

If you are interested in these topics or want to study together,
please feel free to contact me.

Thank you, everyone.
